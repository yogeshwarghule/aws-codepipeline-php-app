# README

Welcome to this PHP application! This application is designed to be deployed using AWS CodePipeline and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy this application, you will need to set up your AWS environment. This includes creating an AWS account, setting up an IAM user with appropriate permissions, and installing and configuring the AWS CLI.

You will also need to create a container image that contains your application code and any dependencies. This can be done using a Dockerfile or by building an image from an existing container registry.

## Deployment

To deploy this application using AWS CodePipeline and Amazon ECS, follow these steps:

1. Store your container image in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
2. Create an Amazon ECS task definition that specifies your container image and any other required details.
3. Create an Amazon ECS service to deploy your application to.
4. Create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket to store the artifacts that are generated by your CodePipeline.
5. Create an AWS CodeCommit repository to store your application code in.
6. Create an AWS CodePipeline to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your application.
7. Configure your CodePipeline to specify the details of your deployment process, including the source code repository, the build and test actions to be performed, and the deployment target (your ECS service). You will also need to specify the triggers that will cause your CodePipeline to be executed, such as changes to your source code or the completion of a previous stage in the pipeline.

## Maintenance

To update your application, simply make the desired changes to your code and push them to the CodeCommit repository. Your CodePipeline will automatically pick up the changes and deploy them to your ECS service.
